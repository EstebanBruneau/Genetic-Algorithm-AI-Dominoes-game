# Machine-Learning-for-Dominoes-game
This project is an AI-based player for the game of Dominoes. Machine learning is done by natural selection, and the AI has a Neural Network structure that is adaptable.
Did not use any existing AI libraries.

## Features
Play Modes:
  Human vs Human: Play the game against another player on the same terminal.
  Human vs AI: Play the game against an AI opponent.
  AI vs AI: Watch two AI players compete against each other.
  
AI Strategies:
  Random: The AI makes random moves.
  Highest First: The AI prioritizes playing the highest value dominoes.

Genetic Algorithm: The AI uses a genetic algorithm to evolve and improve its strategy over time.

Terminal-Based Interface: All interactions are done through the terminal. The UI interface is currently not functional.
